    <h1>Glitch Art</h1>
    <p>In this project, I used text editor recreate a glitch image with replace the text, and extend its
      body, repeat it as well. The concept is blur the image and make it unclean. And people can guess
      the original looks and may have ambiguities.</p><br><br><br><br>

    <h1>COMPOSITE ART PROJECT</h1>
    <p>
      Our group Yingshi Feng, Guoxun Wu and ( ) concept is to make place series about
      environmental pollution. My concept is rebuilt the exist neighbor place to talk about the
      environment and plastic waste issues. I search the image about plastic pollution, then put them
      together to make a new collage art. I name it“Plastic State Bridge ”.</p><br><br><br><br>

    <h1>Audio/Video Art Project</h1>
    <p>The concept behind this project is inspired by my own emotion during waking up in the morning.
      I usually start with very quiet when I open eyes, then more and more things enter my brain and
      push me to wake up. It reminds me the feeling of unexpected, confused and unknowing. Also
      recently I am making watercolor painting, I really like the fantastic and dreamlike tones of it.
      Then I use ink in water to create this particular feeling because when the ink drops in water it
      becomes an unexpected shape. The light background and water sound help emphasis this concept
      as well.</p><br><br><br><br>

    <h1>Net Art Project</h1>
    <p>
      In our project, "Memory". I had created a web page with my group member Yingshi, it inspired
      by our earlier internet memories. It's a combination of earlier chatting environment we used and
      the classic pixel game. The style we made is base on the experience at that time period. Such as
      the text, screen, button, sound and border style. Also the thing with many "errors".</p><br><br><br><br>

    <h1>Code Art Project</h1>
    <p>Recently I stress by many things surrounding me, it inspired me to created this project and trying to reduce some stress. In this project, I load the image that I prepare in the photoshop. Then use mouse clicked function to interact with the
      viewer.</p><br><br><br><br>
