    <h3>"Green Space",Dightal Video,2 mins"</h3>
    <p>This piece is an exploration of the environment and how technology changes the way people view the outdoor space. I was shotting as traveling in a natural area. In the other hands, I create two screens. The main screen is showing the front
      view, and I used the door as a transmission to guilds the viewer softly enter natural spaces from the indoor environment. The second screen sets down on the floor where the viewer stands; it shows the overlook view from the top and gives an
      immersive experience to the viewer; especially the video has connects and synchronize the picture with the main screen together.</p>
