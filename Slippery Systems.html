      <p>The way that I interpret this is plainâ€¦ to abandon restrictions, one must not fear to make risky decisions, escape what you have always known to discover places new.
        The artwork I chose to create signifies just this. The hummingbird who has lived inside of the book attempts to breaks free from its world, no longer being restricted by the pages. The flowers are blooming into unexplored freedom. </p>
