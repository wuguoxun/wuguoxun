      <p>The way that I interpret this is plain… to abandon restrictions, one must not fear to make risky decisions, escape what you have always known to discover places new.
        The artwork I chose to create signifies just this. The hummingbird who has lived inside of the book attempts to breaks free from its world, no longer being restricted by the pages. The flowers are blooming into unexplored freedom. </p>

      <h4>Exercise 1, Oblique Strategies and Slippery Systems
        Part 1 -- Oblique Strategies

        Allow an Easement

        INT. SJSU ART BUILDING ROOM 237 – AFTERNOON

        <br>Wen, Arantxa, and William are presenting their artworks in class Art 103. The concept is based on Oblique Strategies they chose – Allow an Easement.<br>

        <br>WEN
        (Smiling)
        <br>Good afternoon. My name is Wen.
        The Oblique Strategies we chose is allow an easement.
        This is my work.

        Suddenly, Wen leaves the room. Arantxa starts to introduce her work.<br>

        <br>ARANTXA <br>
        I’m Arantxa. My work is about…<br>

        <br>When Arantxa finishes her amazing presentation, Wen comes back. She enters the room, finding a chair. Wen sits next to William, put on her headphone, and begin her meditation. William does not even care. He has a wonderful artwork to
        show.<br>

        <br>WILLIAM <br>
        I’m William. My work is about…<br>

        <br>Wen is still meditating…Time passes really slow.<br>

        <br>WILLIAM
        (Smiling)
        Thank you.<br>

        <br>Wen opens her eyes, goes straight to her spot and pack her stuff. Wen leaves the room, not coming back. (Maybe she is in another classroom).
