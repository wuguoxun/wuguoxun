  <h2>Question & Answer</h2>




  <p>Q1. What are the similarities and differences regarding the work of Walter De Maria and Banksy?</p>

  <p>Walter De Maria and Banksy are work similar in the way that they are both like site art. And they also critique the society and trying to address the some problem in their community. The different of them is the way how they made art; De Maria
    uses the practice is connected with Minimal art, Conceptual art, and Land art and all of it basic on the natural space. But Banksy places his art in the street and some of it are illegal. Also Walter De Maria used to recreated existed work and
    Banksy doesn't.</p>

  <p>Q2. What are some of the common creative tactics that all the 'sign art' shares? What must signs have to remain relevant?
  </p>
  <p>I think the most successful sign art have symbolic of the place, and it may perfectly explain or address the story and issue in that specific area. And the sign art should match the field and let the viewer believed it belonged there as well.</p>
  <p>Q3. What Kind of art, not shown here, that have you seen that was made in response to its location, its environment, a specific event or situation. Please elaborate, provide images if possible.
  </p>
  <p>French artist Charles Leval, he injects humor into the streets of Paris by gluing animal and human-shaped pasteups onto walls. A lot of thought goes into location too as each piece usually interacts with its environment in one way or another.</p>

  <p>Q4. Class exercise.</p>
  <p>The group of Guoxun Wu, Yingshi Feng, Chelsea Simmons and Lingyi Song, we plan to do two of the following idea:</p>
  <p>● Student union for critique about healthy food; most of the food is disgusting and high
    in salt and fat.
    ● Yellow, “Up ahead” traffic signs for critique about high costs of living in San Jose.
    San Jose prides itself on diversity yet has a really expensive downtown area that
    doesn't match its high student and homeless population.
    ● Blue safety university phones- critique about slow response to calls
    ● Dumpster -critique about crime in area.
