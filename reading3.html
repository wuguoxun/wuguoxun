  <h2>Question & Answer</h2>




  <p>Q1. From the podcast, How has the evolution of our understanding of what dinoasaurs really look like? Descibe the progression of how we portrayed them and how does this efffect your understanding of what Archeology is studying and producing as
    information.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our initial depictions of dinosaurs are the out looking, it has to huge and contained scales and slender skin and tails, they look dangerous and might roars. Actually, after the research of scientists, the dinosaurs might have soft skin and hair. Even they may not have been able to make such a loud noise as a roar.</p>
<br>
  <p>Q2. The artist/archcologist John Conway who is doing interpretaions of dinosaurs is obviously taking liberty with what could be the actual truth of how these creatures existed. What other disciplines and forms of studies use similer techniques
    that reminds you of this method or process. Please eloborate. </p>
<br>
<p>In today technology, scientists use the specimen and remains infer the accurate result. Such as in astrology, we can learn about the movement and path of a different planet and predict the possibility of the planets colliding.</p>
<br>
  <p>Q3. First summerize in your own words the characteristics of 'Material Speculation', which is this article shows examples for possible future products. How can this also be used to create objects that refer to the past or current moment? </p>
<br>
<p>In my opinion, material speculation is designed to question the world and to let people critique it. It can relate to the history and background story of the artifact and estimate the future.</p>
