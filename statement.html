  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>I'am Guoxun Wu who woking as a digital media artist.I work for this years has used revealing aspects of nature, which have a specific impact on our environment today.  In the current climate where many ignore our planet has got worse, I find myself continually explode the fact to those aspects that are often hidden or misunderstanding. In my varied and diverse approaches to making art; video; installations; processing and web projects, the interaction of the work has an impact on the workâ€™s relationship to the viewer.

<p>The immersive installation video piece <em> "Green Space,"</em> This piece is an exploration of the environment and how technology changes the way people view the outdoor space. I was shotting as traveling in a natural area. In the other hands, I create two screens. The main screen is showing the front view, and I used the door as a transmission to guilds the viewer softly enter natural spaces from the indoor environment. The second screen sets down on the floor where the viewer stands; it shows the overlook view from the top and gives an immersive experience to the viewer; especially the video has connects and synchronize the picture with the main screen together.</p>

<p>My current project <em>"How Video Change Our Life,"</em> I found that the media and video already change the style of our daily life. I created a scene that shows some basic behavior of everyday life. In the other hands, I collect many famous clips on youtube in this few decades, its dialogue with the history & trajectory of video art.</p>

<p><em>Go Though The Dark Clouds,</em> By Guoxun Wu. Currently, I had been suffering in the sorrow of Camp wildfire, and the dark clouds hang over us. This art piece is an exploration of the environment event; it shows the sad news and scenes of the disaster created by the fire, and trying to gives the hope and healing people who were in distress after it.</p>
