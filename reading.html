  <h2>Question & Answer</h2>




  <p>Q1: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IDEAS OF MODULARITY AND TESSELLATION? WHAT ARE THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION WITH EACH OTHER?</p><br>
  <p>Modularity is talk about the component in the system may be separated and recombined, often with the benefit of flexibility and variety in use. Tessellation is a shape that repeated with symmetry. The reason for modularity and tessellation
    opposition with each other, because the modularity can be unique in the system, but tessellation more tends to repeat and connect with others.</p>

  <p>Q2: WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DESIGNING SOMETHING THAT HAS COMPLEXITY (APERIODIC) VS BEING UNIFORM (PERIODIC)?</p><br>
  <p>The periodic tessellation has the same pattern at a different point in the plane. It repeats the shape with symmetry and became a design.
    And the aperiodic tessellation is the opposition with periodic tessellation. It has no translation symmetry. It looks like the irregular random pattern in the design.</p>

  <p>Q3: HOW MIGHT EMERGENT BEHAVIOR BE RELATED TO WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING?</p>
  <p>Emergent is a complex behavior that arises out of a multiplicity of relatively simple interactions from many components. Which means replicated over again and build a larger object. In the tessellation project that I working. I start with the
    single, individual shape and repeat it become a complex design.</p>
